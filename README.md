# HousingPrices
Implement from scratch the ridge regression algorithm for regression with square loss. Apply the algorithm to the prediction of the label medianHouseValue in this dataset. Study the dependence of the cross-validated risk estimate on the parameter alpha of ridge regression. Try using PCA to improve the risk estimate. Optionally, use nested cross-validated risk estimates to remove the need of choosing the parameter.
