# HousingPrices Project
# Implement from scratch the ridge regression algorithm for regression with square loss.
# Apply the algorithm to the prediction of the label medianHouseValue in this dataset.
# Study the dependence of the cross-validated risk estimate on the parameter alpha of ridge regression.
# Try using PCA to improve the risk estimate.
# Optionally, use nested cross-validated risk estimates to remove the need of choosing the parameter.
